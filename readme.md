Create a program that can calculate a mathematical expression

Rules:
- A string is passed to the program on the command line in a command line argument called 'ex1'
- The string is a series of numbers with one kind of operator only  e.g. 1+2+3+4+5, 4*7*2*4, 9/3
- No spaces will exist around the numbers
- Calculate the value from left to right
- Output the result to the console

example run and output
> myprog -ex1 1+2+3+4+5
1+2+3+4+5
15

Extra credit:
Same rules as above EXCEPT numbers can have one or more spaces around them
e.g. 1 + 2  + 3 + 4
(hint: Be sure to trim the number strings)


Here's a starter program to collect command line parameters
